# Welcome to the documentation for MyPledge

Material is a design system created by Google to help teams build high-quality digital experiences for Android, iOS, Flutter, and the web. The biggest part of this product is built on Material 3 with some few components coming from Material design 2 and other design systems that will be noted over time in the documentation and refrenced.

## Principles

* Bold, graphic, intentional
The design is guided by print design methods — typography, grids, space, scale, color, and imagery — to create hierarchy, meaning, and focus that immerse viewers in the experience.

* Human
The design is deeply committed to a high standard of accessibility, honesty, and respect for user attention.

* Focused
The design is aims to deliver what is needed, when its neeedd=ed and why its needed without necessarily destracting the user.

* Motion provides meaning
Motion focuses attention and maintains continuity through subtle feedback and coherent transitions. As elements appear on screen, they transform and reorganize the environment with interactions generating new transformations.

## Components
Material Components are interactive building blocks for creating a user interface, and include a built-in states system to communicate focus, selection, activation, error, hover, press, drag, and disabled states. Component libraries are available for Android, iOS, Flutter, and the web.
